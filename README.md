<p>
This project aims to make legal language accessible by connecting any webpage selection to a reliable community‚Äëmaintained <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a>. Built for researchers, students, and practitioners, the extension provides instant access to legal definitions through multiple interaction methods, sourced from the Justice Definitions Project (MediaWiki), curated and reviewed by experts. The goal is to provide credible, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate explanations grounded in Indian legal context while remaining easy to consult during everyday reading.

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder
5. The extension will appear in your Chrome toolbar

### How It Works

The extension provides multiple ways to access legal definitions:

#### **Right-Click Lookup (Primary Method)**
- **Right-click** on any selected text to trigger instant definition lookup
- **Floating Popup**: A clean, expandable popup appears with definition preview
- **Smart Positioning**: Popup automatically positions itself near your selection
- **Quick Actions**: Request missing definitions or close popup with one click

#### **Side Panel (Extended Browsing)**
- **Click Extension Icon**: Opens a dedicated side panel (25% of window width)
- **Default MediaWiki Content**: Shows Justice Definitions Project main page by default
- **Embedded Browsing**: Full wiki pages displayed directly in the side panel
- **Search Integration**: Search results appear above the embedded content
- **Click-Outside Closure**: Click anywhere outside the panel to close it
- **Seamless Navigation**: Click search results to view full definitions in the panel

#### **Smart Features**
- **Context-Aware**: Automatically detects if side panel is open vs. closed
- **Seamless Integration**: Works on any webpage without interference
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and content lengths

### Side Panel Features

The side panel provides a comprehensive browsing experience with the Justice Definitions Project:

**üè† Default Content:**
- **MediaWiki Integration**: Justice Definitions Project main page loads by default
- **Embedded Browsing**: Full wiki pages displayed directly within the panel
- **Persistent Interface**: Keep the panel open while browsing multiple web pages

**üîç Search & Navigation:**
- **Search Bar**: Manual search for legal terms and definitions
- **Result Display**: Search results appear above the embedded content
- **Direct Navigation**: Click any search result to view the full definition in the panel
- **Seamless Switching**: Easy transition between search results and full wiki pages

**üéØ User Experience:**
- **Click-Outside Closure**: Click anywhere outside the panel to close it
- **No Popup Conflicts**: When panel is open, right-click selections go directly to the panel
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and content lengths
- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, focused design for optimal reading experience

### Two-Way Communication System

This project implements a **two-way communication system** between the browser extension and the Justice Definitions Project:

**üì• Pull Data:** Extension queries the Justice Definitions Project MediaWiki API to retrieve and display legal definitions from the curated knowledge base.

**üì§ Send Requests:** When definitions are not found, users can submit requests for missing terms via webhook integration. These requests are automatically logged to a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15mdKhoJuhdzpeSCL0STRLFI5umMaDF5CCf0D5qiWbOY/edit?usp=sharing) for tracking and community-driven expansion of the database.

**üìä Request Tracking:** All definition requests are captured with:
- Timestamp of the request
- Term requested
- Source page URL where the request was made
- User agent and IP information
- Status tracking for request processing

### Configuration System

**üìÅ Configuration:** The extension uses a centralized `config.js` file for easy customization:

- **External Resources** (ALL-CAPS): `WEBHOOK_URL`, `API_URL` - easily modifiable by developers
- **Internal Settings**: Display limits, timeouts, and extension metadata
- **No Setup Required**: Works out of the box with default Justice Definitions Project webhook
- **Google Sheet Integration**: Requests are automatically logged to the [Justice Definitions Project Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15mdKhoJuhdzpeSCL0STRLFI5umMaDF5CCf0D5qiWbOY/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Custom Options**: Users can override webhook URL via Options page

### About Justice Definitions Project

This extension is built on the **Justice Definitions Project** - an expert-curated, credible knowledge base for legal terminology featuring:

- Expert review workflows and transparent sourcing
- Community contributions from students, researchers, and legal practitioners
- Versioned changes and public discussion for key updates
