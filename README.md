This project aims to make legal language accessible by connecting any webpage selection to a reliable community‚Äëmaintained <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a>. Built for researchers, students, and practitioners, the extension lets you select a term on any page and instantly shows a concise
definition preview sourced from the <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a> (MediaWiki), curated and reviewed
by experts. The goal is to provide credible, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate explanations
grounded in Indian legal context while remaining easy to consult during everyday reading.

### Demo üé•

Coming soon

### What this extension does

- Select any word/term on a webpage and open the extension popup
- The extension searches the <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a> for the most relevant page
- It displays the first 140 characters from the page intro and links to the source, so you can read more in context

### Why ‚Äúreliable‚Äù Justice Definitions

We are evolving this effort toward an expert‚Äëcurated, credible knowledge base for legal terminology.
The intent is to reduce ambiguity and ensure reliability by incorporating:

- Expert review workflows (domain experts vet definitions and updates)
- Transparent sourcing and citations
- Versioned changes and public discussion for key updates

While the extension already integrates with the <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a>, the ‚Äúcredible‚Äù
designation reflects the ongoing work to formalise governance, review, and publishing standards.

### Governance and contributions

- Editorial guidance: legal academics and practitioners help set standards
- Review flow: submissions and edits are reviewed by experts before publication
- Community: students, researchers, and contributors can propose improvements and citations

If you‚Äôre an expert or institution and would like to participate in curation,
please open an issue or reach out to collaborate.

This project is originally created and open‚Äësourced by **[Sandeep Suman](https://github.com/SandeepKrSuman)**.
The current version adapts the lookup to use the **[Justice Definitions Project](https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project)** (MediaWiki) as the primary
data source for legal terms, fetching a page intro and displaying the first 140 characters with a link back
to the source. Prior versions referenced the Free Dictionary API for general‚Äëpurpose terms.
