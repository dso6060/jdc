<p>
This project aims to make legal language accessible by connecting any webpage selection to a reliable community‚Äëmaintained <a href="https://jdc-definitions.wikibase.wiki/wiki/The_Justice_Definitions_Project">Justice Definitions Project</a>. Built for researchers, students, and practitioners, the extension automatically shows definition previews when you select text on any webpage, sourced from the Justice Definitions Project (MediaWiki), curated and reviewed by experts. The goal is to provide credible, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate explanations grounded in Indian legal context while remaining easy to consult during everyday reading.

### Installation üß©

**Chrome Extension (Development Version):**
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder
5. The extension will appear in your Chrome toolbar

### How It Works

- **Automatic Popup**: Select any word/term on a webpage and a floating popup appears instantly
- **Smart Lookup**: The extension automatically searches the Justice Definitions Project for the most relevant page
- **Quick Preview**: Displays a concise definition preview with a link to the full wiki page
- **Seamless Experience**: No need to click the extension icon - definitions appear automatically on text selection

### Two-Way Communication System

This project implements a **two-way communication system** between the browser extension and the Justice Definitions Project:

**üì• Pull Data:** Extension queries the Justice Definitions Project MediaWiki API to retrieve and display legal definitions from the curated knowledge base.

**üì§ Send Requests:** When definitions are not found, users can submit requests for missing terms via webhook integration, enabling community-driven expansion of the database.

### Configuration System

**üìÅ Configuration:** The extension uses a centralized `config.js` file for easy customization:

- **External Resources** (ALL-CAPS): `WEBHOOK_URL`, `API_URL` - easily modifiable by developers
- **Internal Settings**: Display limits, timeouts, and extension metadata
- **No Setup Required**: Works out of the box with default Justice Definitions Project webhook
- **Custom Options**: Users can override webhook URL via Options page

### About Justice Definitions Project

This extension is built on the **Justice Definitions Project** - an expert-curated, credible knowledge base for legal terminology featuring:

- Expert review workflows and transparent sourcing
